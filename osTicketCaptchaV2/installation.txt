This is a direct drop-in replacement for the default osTicket captcha system which generates a user configurable random Captcha.

You can customise the following:

* You can specify the font face with a file (default is arial.ttf)
* You can specify the font size (default is 18, which seems optimal to me - should be changed from /captch.php where class is invoked)
* Characters can be rendered in colour or grayscale
* Background can be generated from random colour or random grayscale pixels
* Characters can be generated in fixed or random colour/random grayscale
* You can set the upper and lower RGB/grayscale intensity for the background pixels, to adjust contrast between background and text
* You can customise pixel size for the randomly generated background (default is 6x6 pixel squares)
* You can set (or disable with 0) a random rotation range for characters
* You can adjust the margin for the character cells/random character placement routines

This generator uses a font file (arial.ttf is included in this zip) and can be installed simply by extracting the contents
of the upload folder to the root of your osTicket installation.  Because this will overwrite the existing file at:
/include/class.captcha.php  I have included a file named class.captcha.original.php which contains the original (v1.11) php code,
this is also available from: https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/blob/develop/include/class.captcha.php

These modifications have been made to the original files of a clean osTicket v1.11 installation.  Looking at the files dating
back to osTicket v1.7 the default Captcha system appears to be unchanged, so whilst I make no guarantees - I belive this solution
will work for older versions as it stands.

Once it is installed, you can test it by accessing https://yourosticketsite/captcha.php where you can refresh to keep generating
new codes - useful for testing it whilst tweaking the settings.

I will be creating a full manageable plugin soon which adds the functionality of this solution and also Google ReCaptcha.

I hope you find this useful!
