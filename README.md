# osTicket bits and bobs

This is where I'll post my osTicket mods/plugins as I create them!

I will be creating a full non-core-altering plugin soon which adds the functionality of my osTicketCaptchaV2 solution (which still has its own usefulness) but also Google ReCaptcha.

If you find my work useful and fancy saying thanks, you can buy me a drink via PayPal at:
